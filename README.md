# Topology Generation from YAML Files
This project focuses on generating network topologies from YAML files using Python and the Django framework. The topologies are visualized in an intuitive way with the help of libraries like NetworkX and Matplotlib.

# Project Overview
The application takes YAML files as input, processes the data, and generates visual network topologies based on the content of the file. It leverages the power of Django's web framework to allow users to upload files and view generated network graphs in a browser.

## Key Features:
- Upload YAML files through a web interface.
- Automatic network topology generation from the YAML structure.
- Visual representation of the network using NetworkX and Matplotlib.
- Simple, user-friendly interface built with Django.
- File history tracking with uploaded file details and graph links.
  
## Tech Stack
- *Programming Language:* Python
- *Framework:* Django
- *Database:* SQLite (default Django database)
- *Libraries:*
  - NetworkX: For generating and manipulating complex networks.
  - PyYAML: To parse and process YAML files.
  - Matplotlib: For graph visualization and rendering.
